## **Advanced**

### Config presets
***exec** runs a config with a supplied name from "anoxdata/configs"*
*example: "exec anox" runs "anoxdata/configs/anox.cfg"*




### Invoking events
***invoke** runs the event of the id supplied. The events can be global or local, they are stored in gamefiles of .ape extension. To find out event ids you can look through the decompiled scripts [here](https://github.com/AlpacaNox/Anachronox/tree/master/APE/Gameflow)*

**Invoke** is used a lot throughout the game for UI and any sorts of in-game events.

### Running cinematics

For a cinematic to play properly you would need the party to be at the map it is taking place at, otherwise the cinematic will still play but the environment won't match. 

Most script files already contain the map name in the name of their script file which helps to figure out where to play them. For example for the script file **fortress2_detta_intro.s** the name of the map would be **fortress2**.

### Playing cinematics with the "playscene" console command

To play a cinematic open the console and type in:
**map *nameofthemap* **
**extern "playscene *cinematicnamehere*"**

for example:
**map black**
**extern "playscene black_intro"**
will run the Main Menu Intro cinematic — **black_intro.s**

### Playing cinematics with Planet (in-game cinematic editor)
Playing cinematics that way will show a lot of extra things on screen, you will be able to see how the cinematics were put together. This engine module was used to make all cutscenes in the game and left for modders to use. Similarly as for the previous approach you will need to first use **map** command to load the proper environment.

To play cinematic with Planet:
open the console and type in:
**map *nameofthemap* **
**planet**
This will run Planet. To be able to click on the buttons press the **TAB** key.
* Click on the **File** button
* Type in the name of the script you would like to play
* Click on the **Load** button
* Press **F5** to start playing the cinematic and **F8** to stop

### List of the script files

*amb / ambi scripts are usually little scripts used to control environment on the maps, these are not really cinematics and are used for animating little scenes to play on a background*

*some cinematics are so huge that they were split on several script files and then chained together in-game*
