title: Battle Keyboard Controls
slug: "/guides/anachronox/battle-keyboard-controls"

The game allows to control the party during battles using a keyboard. This is an undocumented feature. 
Controls:

Number keys — select actions, party members and targets
Tab key — switch between the party members
Esc — cancel current action
Enter / Space — confirm selected action

Things break when trying to combine both types of controls (mouse and keyboard).

Actions:

## Beat Attack
Using keyboard controls it is possible to:
1. Target unreachable enemies (obstructed by someone or something) if using ranged weapons
2. Attack friendly characters including the currently active character


A simple example on how attack a party member:
	1. Press 1 to select Beat Attack action
	2. Hover over any party member's portrait to select them
	3. Target any enemy using the number keys
	4. Click on the party member's portrait

## Use Item
Same targeting options as for the previous action. The only difference is that there are items that are made for friendly characters / party members. Combining keyboard and mouse controls allows to use these items on enemies.

A simple example on how use a healing item on an enemy:
	1. Press 3 to select Use Item action
	2. Select any healing item
	3. Hover over any enemy portrait
	4. Press a number key to select a party member
	5. Click on the enemy's portrait

## Mystech
Same targeting options as for the previous actions.

The option can be selected even if no mystech or shield is equipped:
1. If no mystech is equipped the game will crash when selecting mystech power
2. If no shield is equipped the action will not go past targeting stage (can be canceled)

Using keyboard controls allows to bypass NRG requirements almost completely. Party member doesn't need to have enough NRG or shield throughput in order to use it. For this to work a shield needs to have enough throughput to cast at least the first power of mystech.

When using mouse controls the game usually allows to select mystech power out of 4 options (from 1 to 4). When using keyboard controls there are up to to 10 options (0-9 number keys). The outcome depends on a currently equipped shieldcell and presence of cobalt crawlers in the combination.

*Keyboard controls allow using mystech during the battle with Rictus.*

*Targeting with keyboard allows to use mystech on dead party members. That allows to use Bane mystech on a dead character which results in reviving.*

## Skill
Same targeting options as for the previous actions.

Unlike with mystech selecting a skill with keyboard without enough bouge will not allow it to be used.

Many skills are hardcoded to affect specific party members. For example using FatimaScreen on some other character will still apply all effects to Boots and play animation correctly.

The area of effect skills that do damage will affect every enemy regardless of selected target + selected target. So selecting ally when using a skill will only damage 1 ally character + every other enemy character.
