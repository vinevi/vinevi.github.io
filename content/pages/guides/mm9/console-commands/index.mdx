To open the console add:

```"consolekey" "192"```

to ```autoexec.cfg```, which can be found in the game's folder

This will set the `~` key to open the console

The complete list of commands can be viewed using ctrl+tab combination

Navigating the console is done using ```ctrl + pageUp``` / ```pageDown``` combinations.

Running the commands will also add them to autoexec once the game is closed, so make sure to back it up before typing anything in.

Adding ```"runworld" "mapname"``` to ```autoexec.cfg``` will open the set map once the game is loaded. Example:

```"runworld" "worlds\Guberland"```
