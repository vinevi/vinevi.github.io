## Notes
[Empty Crystal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tMXKeSBH2I "Empty Crystal")

Initially the autosave will be out of bounds, to avoid it: make a save inside Escaton's Crystal and load it prior to the autosave. The other way is to exit with exit click buffer.

The glitch does not remove monsters from the dungeon but prevents them from spawning, so it will only work when entering the first time, hence the need for a separate save outside.

Plane of Water entrance - 6 items
Heart of Water - 1 item
Plane of Air entrance - 6 items

Using H key to hire makes it slightly faster.
Re-entering the inn will automatically place the cursor on the first character in the inn.
