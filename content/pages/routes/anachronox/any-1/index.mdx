## Route

### The Bricks

- [Skip the first fight and Bricks Intro](https://youtu.be/roHPGGb-VJA?t=360)
*Optionally keep a save right after exiting Rowdy's, that will be an easy way later on to trigger battleskip.*

- Visit Deanamo
- Skip "Meeting Grumpos" (Quit and load the cinematic save, unload will happen after the elevator")
- Activate battleskip before exiting Tenements or Building 5
- Get the helmet
- Go back to Grumpos (Skipping the cinematic is not much faster than a normal way)
- Talk to The Doorlord 
*otherwise he will disappear after you exit the tunnels, softlocking the game*
- [Speedstrafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p65uCDjPSZc
) [over the fence to enter the tunnels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTofhWZLZIs)
- [Get a Stargent Laserblade from the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDQ2cZLG2o4)

- [Skip Stone Sentinel using the cinematic](https://youtu.be/roHPGGb-VJA?t=1771)
- Skip "Meeting Detta" (Quit and load the cinematic save, unload will happen after the elevator")
- Sell everything except for Stargent Laserblade to Ghalla
- Skip "K'Conrad Speaks Again" (Quit and load the cinematic save, unload will happen after the elevator")
- Go to Tours and buy a battery from Bloomgold
- Warp back to Rowdy's with "Anachronox Intro". PAL-18 Wakes.
- After the cutscene activate the battleskip
- Back to Tours, buy tickets (only Grumpos can buy) and travel to Sender.

### Sender Station

- Save the game to a new slot (keep it)
- Skip "What's the Plan, Stan?"
- Go to Vend'O'Mart and hack the terminal. (To unlock the cutscene ("Disguises") for warping).
- Skip the cutscene and load the save when arrived to the station.
- Clip out of bounds (Meeting Detta is the one I use), then clip into the corridor leading to the Rho's shuttle(Stone Sentinel)

### Hephaestus

- Buy Mysteria Gold Shieldcell
- Pickup Annulet of Alertness on the way.
- Optionally take a petal on the way
- Get to the front entrance of the Tower.
- [Save, play PAL18 Wakes, load the save, wait till the end of the cinematic, save, load. Talk to Grumpos](https://youtu.be/gsG6hxffgPw?t=2981)
*That will pull Grumpos from the elevator shaft to the first floor of the tower, make PAL active and warp Boots here as well.*
- Talk to Grumpos

### Sender Station

- Warp with "Disguises"
- Go to Routubes
- Optionally pick up a yellow bug
- [Clip out of bounds and reach the trigger leading to the next level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5TXo_zithk)
- Save right after entering Routubes 2 since it is very likely that the cinematic will unload right after the map transition
- Pick up a grey bug
- Pick up a red bug
- Get to the Red Light District
- Talk to floater to get a cobalt crawler [Will make elementor attacks AOE]
- Pickup a Turboalert Wristpincher
- Complete the "Ring" quest and skip "Stiletto Dance"(will unload together with "Disguises" after warping)
- Warp with "Disguises"
- Complete the PAL's section, right after PAL-18 and Stiletto leave the museum. Save and warp with "PAL-18 Drops the Ball"
- Get back to the Lounge of Commerce, skip Universe Troubles, warp with Disguises
- Collect enough petals to level up the elementor up to 80 output or more, add a cobalt crawler to the combo
- Warp to Limbus

### Limbus

- Activate battleskip
- Reach Sesostris, skip Prisoners of Limbus
- Equip Boots with a shieldcell and elementor
- Volunteer at every position as Boots
- After done with the event warp back to Sender, get to the Lounge of Commerce, take PAL-18, then go back to the place where Stiletto's worldskill tutorial should've happened. This will add her to the party. Now warp back to Crevice with "Big Gun Outro".
- Get to Santa, skip The Dome cutscene, warp to Rowdy's with Anachronox Intro 

### Rowdys

- Warp back to Sender with "Disguises" during the cutscene. You'll need to progress in dialogue while Disguises plays.

### Sender

- Level up the elementor up to ~180 output. I am not sure how much exactly is required to oneshot the orbs in the final fight, but that seems like enough.
- Talk to someone, then get to the space station and take a shuttle to Anachronox
- Buy the tickets to OneGate

### OneGate

- Buy a Detta Shieldcell from Parvenute

### Detta Fortress 

### Grounds

- [Hold "back" right after assembling the parties and pressing accept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UY_x15dYBE)

### Basement

- [Warp as Boots to skip the door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UY_x15dYBE)
* The cinematic will either unload shortly after warp or after toggling the bridge by PAL
- Unlock the left console with PAL, lower the bridge, enter A C K M: Astro Cordica Kepler Mojo
- Leave the level

### Fortress

- PAL: unlock the console, open the door security level 1
- Boots: use control panel, enter Q A E: Quasar Astro Eternal. Unlock security level 2
- Pal: unlock the generator panel, take a corridor to the right, use control panel
- Stiletto: use transport pods, unlock the pods for Boots
- Boots: use the pods < the only thing that matters here

### Upper Fortress

- Boots: activate the airlock, unlock the chamber door, activate platform
- Stiletto: unlock the workshop door
- PAL: reach the workshop control panel, unlock security level 4
- Boots: activate the airlock
- Boots: buy 5 Turboalert Wristpinchers
- PAL: activate airlock 2
- All groups enter airlock 2
- Gather everyone near the big door
- Reset the game to get rid of the battleskip
- Equip Stiletto with a TurboAlert Wristpincher, Detta Shieldcell and a Bane Elementor. Equip the rest of the party (except Grumpos) with TurboAlert Wristpinchers. 
- The first phase: 1 bane attack + 1 beat attack by Stiletto. The second phase: ??? (It was supposed to be 5 attacks by Stiletto + 1 Pain Pirouette, but that is inconsistent)

### Echo Gate

- Makes sense to let Boots move in first since his element is ice and no one's got anything to resist it
- Stiletto spams Bane elementor, others move in
* the move point for spheres is always the last one in the menu

## Notes

new:

bricks > hephtower > slounge > limbus > rowdys > hephpoor > slounge > onegate  > outro

est possible 01:30:00

 there is a way to level up Stiletto. Warp back to slounge after getting her from Onegate cutscene. Then play Detta fortress intro anywhere to restart the fortress mission.
hephpoor after Rowdys is to get rid of the party members. That warps PAL to slounge so that we can talk to him and unlock the trigger at onegate for Detta Fortress mission. Since it warps only PAL you can't buy onegate pass at this point since you need someone other than Boots or PAL to do that, that is why it is a good idea to buy the pass prior to leaving Bricks the first time as Grumpos.

losing all the awards and gold after talking to Santa with old party. However the Big Gun Outro autosave got everything you had prior to talking so that you can transfer (dupe) annulet of alertness, firestorm if needed.

should have 5200+ cr prior to going to tours. Since 5k unlocks the OneGate Pass button. And 200 is required to buy a battery.

1 save at sender shuttle [to warp to limbus, bricks, talk to Santa (warp with Big Gun Outro)]
1 save at Hephaestus Ed's shop > 1 at Entertainment district [shield dupe, can be rewritten afterwards]
1 save at lounge post elementor tutorial (warp to Limbus as solo Boots, talk to Grumpos after Limbus)
from that save equip shield, and warp to Limbus as Boots solo
1 save at Parvenute to buy 2 Detta Shieldcells and Poison Tempest
1 save at Hephaestus near the annulet of alertness for duping
buy One Gate pass before leaving Bricks the first time
!Tower entrance not required, just a shieldcell

Before Detta Bossfight Boots should have Detta Shieldcell + Firestorm and Stiletto should have Detta Shieldcell + Poison Tempest.

Both have dot which gives the highest possible damage output.

Detta is invulnerable to psy and freeze

use Burn mystech from a shoopkeeper at Limbus + Mysteria Gold Shieldcell to get through the Limbus event. Get a better shield and use the same mystech in the final fight to get rid of orbs.

Can get PsySummonHarmonic from Mad Caleb at Tours for free (Post Limbus) 

+ Bricks pickups: Batt + Stargent Laserblade
+ skip PAL mission
+ buy and dupe weapons at Zordos after The Dome
+ skip Fortress1
