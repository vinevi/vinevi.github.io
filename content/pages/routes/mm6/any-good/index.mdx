## Notes

### Knight start notes
- No need for setting up hitbox in the beginning, because that can be done later.
- It seems like the first swap and extra save need to happen at New Sorpigal otherwise character that will come back in place of the Knight (after the party dies) will be buffed up which will not allow party to travel.
- The character who casted fly spell needs to be swapped last to retain the buff after death. (Example p1 uses the fly scroll and so is swapped last). It is used to not dupe the scroll.
- After party dies it can freely travel with the Knight without crashing.
- To be able to open the Knight's inventory you'd need to give him some items first. The last item gets equipped automatically[?]. (example uses crossbow + axe).
