#### Description

[video demo](https://youtu.be/t4XlI6lKLoQ)

The mod removes pause from most of the gameplay mechanics.
That prevents looting chests, inventory management and such in dangerous areas. Which may contribute to a more hardcore experience.

#### Installation

Download: [Github](https://gist.github.com/vinevi/b9dc8d03d2d33d840c346ec830fb6c48) / [Local](/mods/mm6/mm6-realtime-mod.zip)

1. Install [MMExtension](https://github.com/GrayFace/MMExtension)
2. Download the [script](https://gist.github.com/vinevi/b9dc8d03d2d33d840c346ec830fb6c48) and place it in the ```/scripts/general``` directory

#### Pause removed from:

* Character screen
* Chest screen
* Cast screen and cast target select. The party is also allowed to move while selecting the target
* Tooltip (right-click)
* Map transition screen (dungeons and outdoor areas)
* Autonotes
* House screen
* NPC conversation screens
* Rest screen

**! Turnbased mode is disabled**

**! Game completion untested**

One of the new features is that the game will keep rendering on map transition and NPC conversation screens.

Since the mod introduced a lot new contexts for party to die in the game did not really expect them by default. That includes:
dying with cast screen on, dying with options screen on and such. That often led to UI issues. I tried to prevent those by removing those
screens on death so hopefully it is resolved now. There may be however some contexts that can lead to crashes still.
