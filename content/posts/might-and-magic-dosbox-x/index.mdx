Might & Magic VI on current Windows — bad inacurate experience 😒, that requires patching (unless you enjoy walking sideways and moonwalking NPCs which is fine because everyone should be able to choose how to experience the world of Might & Magic and not be judged for their choice). If you don't really care about running the game as it was running in 98 and enjoy it as it is then you probably don't need it.

Might & Magic VI emulated — cool and epic as intended™ experience 🔥🔥🔥 (runs really well, 40-60 FPS on a [dual core machine](https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-3-3200u) 💪, **now that is epic**). If you are a purist like me 😏 you are in the right place to satisfy the needs. **It just feels different**. Imagine emulating Pentium on your i9 now that is dumb (epic) 🤭. The hitching and frame drops — its all as if I am in 98 again! You actually get to look at the loading screen 😯! (its a very nice piece of artwork).

To test it on your machine:

* [Download DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/)
* Download the snapshot: [M&M VI version 1.0](https://mm6.wiki/files/dosbox-x/mm6_1.0_win95_dosbox_x.zip) (vanilla fresh release as if you've just bought the buggy game in 1998 and are ready to experience what Jon have prepared for you) or [M&M VI version 1.2](https://mm6.wiki/files/dosbox-x/mm6_1.2_win95_dosbox_x.zip) (all NWC patches applied)
* Run DOSBox-X. Click **Main** on the top bar and select **Restart DOSBox-X with config file ...**. Then select **win95.conf** from the snapshot's archive. Or if you are a hackerman you can just run this from the terminal: ```dosbox-x -conf win95.conf``` from the snapshot's directory.

That is all! 😎 Windows 95 should boot shortly and all you need is to click on the red dragon shortcut on the desktop to run the game.

Here is also a [speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXudGYLwkpM) I have done some time ago to proove that the game is completable.

If you would like to run Might & Magic VII it is possible as well!. Note that it is much more demanding in terms of performance, at least in outdoor areas. It is also not compatible with Pentium MMX / Pentium Pro CPU types so make sure ```cputype=pentium``` is set in the ```win95.conf``` file.
